# Engine Simulator

A static web-based interactive engine simulation tool designed with an engineering-focused interface inspired by MATLAB Simulink and LabVIEW.

## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive engine simulation environment that provides:

- Real-time thermodynamic cycle visualization
- Interactive parameter adjustment
- Performance metric analysis
- Emission modeling and analysis
- Engineering-grade visualization and controls

## Architecture

**Static Web Application**
- Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- No build tools or frameworks initially
- Designed for GitHub Pages deployment
- Client-side computation using Web Workers

**Interface Design Philosophy**
- Engineering tool aesthetic (inspired by Simulink/LabVIEW)
- Functional, grid-based layouts
- Technical typography and color schemes
- Modular panel system
- Professional scientific instrument appearance

## Features (Planned)

### Core Simulation
- [ ] Otto and Diesel cycle modeling
- [ ] Multi-cylinder engine support
- [ ] Turbocharging and supercharging
- [ ] Variable valve timing
- [ ] Fuel injection systems

### Visualization
- [ ] Real-time P-V diagrams
- [ ] Temperature and pressure plots
- [ ] 3D engine geometry visualization
- [ ] Performance characteristic maps

### Analysis Tools
- [ ] Emissions modeling (NOx, CO, HC, PM)
- [ ] Fuel consumption analysis
- [ ] Thermal efficiency calculations
- [ ] Knock detection and modeling

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
- **Computation**: Web Workers for intensive calculations
- **Graphics**: Canvas API and/or WebGL for visualizations
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static hosting)

## Development

This is a static web application. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to run the simulator.

For development with live reload:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if available)
npx serve .
```
